## Web Developer & DevOps Engineer 👋

### About Me 👨‍💻

Software Engineer with an interest in web development. I have been coding for the past 10 years when I started my bachelor's in Software Engineering. As far as web development in concerned, I have been working primarily with Agile/DevOps methofology.

### Tech Stack 🧱

Currently, I am using the Python/Javascript stack with MongoDb as my weapon of choice. I really enjoyed using React.js as my first javascript framework. In addition to JavaScript, I have also used Flask, NodeJs/Express, and PHP/Symfony in the past with relational databases like MySQL. As for the things I am currently learning, NodeJs and React.js are two technologies I look forward to trying.
