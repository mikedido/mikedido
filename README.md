## Mahdi GUEFFAZ (mikedido in the world of computer science) - Web Developer & DevOps Engineer 👋

### About Me 👨‍💻

Aspiring Software Engineer with an interest in web development. I have been coding for the past 2 years when I started my bachelor's in Software Engineering. As far as web development in concerned, I have been working primarily with front-end technologies.

### Tech Stack 🧱

Currently, I am using the MERN stack as my weapon of choice. I really enjoyed using React.js as my first javascript framework. In addition to JavaScript, I have also used Python, Java, and C++ in the past. As for the things I am currently learning, Firebase and Next.js are two technologies I look forward to trying.

### Blogging 📜

Apart from coding, I have recently started writing technical blog posts. Writing is something I've always enjoyed and writing about the things I love is a very rewarding feeling. I mainly write about topics related to web development, programming, and productivity. Feel free to check out my blog [Code With mikedido](https://mikedido.github.io/).

### Hobbies 🐧

My Hobbies include playing football, watching YouTube videos, and playing video games. While coding, I prefer to have coffee to help me focus.

### My Setup 💻

As far as the tech I use daily, my laptop of choice is a Lenovo ThinkPad. For my operating system, I have dabbled with Linux distros in the past but currently I am using Windows 10 with WSL2 installed. I find it to be the best of both worlds and it meets my needs nicely.
